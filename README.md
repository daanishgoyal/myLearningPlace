# myLearningPlace

We have created a marketplace platform that connects customers with tutors teaching various skills.
This platform is for services related to nonâ€“technical and extra curricular activities like Yoga, Music, and Singing, etc.

For example, if a user from Gainesville wants to learn Yoga online; after logging into our platform, the user is able to view the list of tutors filtered by the serach containing the skill and city. The user will also be able to view the different slots/timings per week given by the tutor, and the price range (negotiable with the tutor) to pay on an hourly basis, the tutor's years of experience, mode of teaching, etc.

The user then will be able to make an informed decision to select the tutor based on pricing, suitable slot timings, ratings of the tutor, years of experience of tutor in teaching that art, among various factors.

In this manner, a person can choose learn any skill they wish by just sitting at home and having a PC with internet.
